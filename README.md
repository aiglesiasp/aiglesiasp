# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name is Aitor Iglesias
### I'm a full-stack iOS & Android engineer

![https://github.com/antoniolg](https://yt3.ggpht.com/V94-R66lnyAKjlb4LGhoxF1_XuNTeA6Y5r2WYrb3x6EYbqIw1Yh_uxUddgQACOmBJYPMFJ-FMXA=w2120-fcrop64=1,00005a57ffffa5a8-k-c0xffffffff-no-nd-rj)

I am a Telecommunications Engineer with a passion for technology and sports.

My professional career has developed in the telecommunications field, where I have accumulated extensive experience as a Network Technician and had the opportunity to lead teams as a Systems and Networks Coordinator. For over 20 years, I have combined this career with my other great passion: basketball. I have been a coach, player, and referee, as well as a coordinator of teams and clubs, which has allowed me to develop leadership and group management skills.

At the same time, I have dedicated time to programming, teaching myself and completing courses on renowned platforms like KeepCoding and ArchitectCoders, with the goal of becoming a FullStack Developer specializing in iOS and Android. This combination of technical skills and leadership experience enables me to approach software development projects from a comprehensive perspective, applying both technological knowledge and the ability to coordinate teams and resources effectively.

My goal is to continue growing in the software development field, adding value through the combination of my expertise in telecommunications, programming, and team management.
